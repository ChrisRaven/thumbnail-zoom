This git repository holds the source code for Thumbnail Zoom Plus, which is
David Adler's fork of the Thumbnail Zoom add-on for Mozilla Firefox.

Thumbnail Zoom Plus is a Firefox addon which shows ful-sized images in a pop-over window when
you hover over a thumbnail.  It works with sites like Facebook, Amazon, Imgur, Flickr, Reddit, 
and many others, including most sites which link directly to full-size images.   
This is a fork (derivation from) thumbnail-zoom by Andres Hernandez.

You can find this add-on on the official Firefox Add-on site:

    https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/thumbnail-zoom-plus/ .



Tips for developers:


DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT:

For general info about developing plug-ins see
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Building_an_Extension

For tips on setting up your dev environment see
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Setting_up_extension_development_environment

If you're using the Restartless Restart add-on, also turn on Disable Fastload
in its preferences.

In my developer profile in Firefox, I create a pointer file as follows
(this should work on OSX or Linux but your directory may vary; on Windows see
the mozilla link above).

  cd $HOME/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/7sep123p.developer/extensions
  echo /$HOME/doc_no_sync/projects/thumbnail-zoom/thumbnail-zoom/src > thumbnailZoom@dadler.github.com

where $HOME/doc_no_sync/projects/thumbnail-zoom/thumbnail-zoom is the location of
my git repository. 

With this pointer in place, to test a change I simply save my source file and restart Firefox
(running my developer profile regular than my regular user profile).

NOTE: if you install the plug-in into this profile using an xpi file, firefox
may remove the pointer file.


DEBUGGING:

To enable debug logging, set enableDebug in common.js.  See comments there for the location
of the log.txt file.  Messages are logged with calls like this:
    this._logger.debug("getPageConstantByDoc");


TESTING:

See src/test/TestCases.html.


MAKING AN INSTALLABLE XPI FILE:

Make an installable xpi file like this:
  cd /Users/dadler/doc_no_sync/projects/thumbnail-zoom/thumbnail-zoom/src
  make

That will create ImageZoom.xpi in ../bin/ .  To install it in a running session of
Firefox, drag-and-drop the xpi file onto the Firefox window.  It'll prompt you to install it,
and will offer to restart Firefox so the change can take effect.  An alternative to drag-and-drop
is to go to the Firefox Add-ons window and do "Instal Add-on From File" from the gear icon menu.
