This git repository holds the source code for David Adler's fork of the ImageZoom add-on for Mozilla Firefox.
The ImageZoom add-on shows a full-size image in a pop-up window when you hover over a thumbnail
image or a link to an image.

Tips for developers:


DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT:

For general info about developing plug-ins see
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Building_an_Extension

For tips on setting up your dev environment see
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Setting_up_extension_development_environment

In particular, in my developer profile in Firefox, I create a symlink is follows
(this should work on OSX or Linux but your directory may vary; on Windows see
the mozilla link above).

  cd $HOME/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/7sep123p.developer/extensions
  ln -s $HOME/doc_no_sync/projects/thumbnail-zoom/thumbnail-zoom/src/ thumbnailZoom@dadler.github.com

where $HOME/doc_no_sync/projects/thumbnail-zoom/thumbnail-zoom is the location of
my git repository. 

With this symlink in place, to test a change I simply save my source file and restart Firefox
(running my developer profile regular than my regular user profile).

CAUTION: if you install the plug-in into this profile using an xpi file, firefox
will remove the symlink and the directory it points to, which may cause you to lose
uncommitted changes in your development tree.


DEBUGGING:

To enable debug logging, set enableDebug in common.js.  See comments there for the location
of the log.txt file.  Messages are logged with calls like this:
    this._logger.debug("getPageConstantByDoc");


INSTALLING FOR NON DEVELOPERS:

Make an installable xpi file like this:
  cd /Users/dadler/doc_no_sync/projects/thumbnail-zoom/thumbnail-zoom/src
  make

That will create ImageZoom.xpi in ../bin/ .  To install it in a running session of
Firefox, drag-and-drop the xpi file onto the Firefox window.  It'll prompt you to install it,
and will offer to restart Firefox so the change can take effect.  An alternative to drag-and-drop
is to go to the Firefox Add-ons window and do "Instal Add-on From File" from the gear icon menu.
