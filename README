This git repository holds the source code for Thumbnail Zoom Plus, which is
David Adler's fork of the Thumbnail Zoom add-on for Mozilla Firefox.

Thumbnail Zoom Plus is a Firefox plug-in which shows a full-size image pop-up 
when you hover over a thumbnail or image link.

When you hover your mouse over a thumbnail or an image or video link, the 
add-on displays the full-size image or video still-frame in a floating window.

The image remains visible until you move the mouse outside the thumb, click 
the mouse, or press Escape. It's quick and easy to move the mouse from one 
thumbnail to another to see the corresponding full-size images.

Supported sites include Amazon, Bing, Facebook, Flickr, Google, IMDb, LinkedIn, 
Netflix, Pinterest, Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter, Yandex.ru, YouTube, Wikipedia, 
WordPress, Yahoo Images, and many more.

Tips for developers:


DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT:

For general info about developing plug-ins see
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Building_an_Extension

For tips on setting up your dev environment see
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Setting_up_extension_development_environment

If you're using the Restartless Restart add-on, also turn on Disable Fastload
in its preferences.

In my developer profile in Firefox, I create a pointer file as follows
on OSX:

  cd "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/"*"/extensions/"
  rm -f thumbnailZoom@dadler.github.com.xpi
  echo $HOME/Documents/p/ff-addons/tzp/thumbnail-zoom/src > thumbnailZoom@dadler.github.com

where $HOME/doc_no_sync/projects/thumbnail-zoom/thumbnail-zoom is the location of
my git repository. 

On Windows the file is in e.g.
%APPDATA%\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\xb77d54w.default\extensions\ and might contain
for example "\\VBOXSVR\src" (without the quotes)

With this pointer in place, to test a change I simply save my source file and restart Firefox
(running my developer profile regular than my regular user profile).

NOTE: if you install the plug-in into this profile using an xpi file, firefox
may remove the pointer file.


DEBUGGING:

To enable debug logging, set enableDebug in common.js.  See comments there for the location
of the log.txt file.  Messages are logged with calls like this:
    this._logger.debug("getPageConstantByDoc");


TESTING:

See src/test/TestCases.html.


MAKING AN INSTALLABLE XPI FILE:

Make an installable xpi file like this:
  cd /Users/dadler/doc_no_sync/projects/thumbnail-zoom/thumbnail-zoom/src
  make

That will create ImageZoom.xpi in ../bin/ .  To install it in a running session of
Firefox, drag-and-drop the xpi file onto the Firefox window.  It'll prompt you to install it,
and will offer to restart Firefox so the change can take effect.  An alternative to drag-and-drop
is to go to the Firefox Add-ons window and do "Instal Add-on From File" from the gear icon menu.
