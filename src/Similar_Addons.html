<h1>Add-ons Similar To Thumbnail Zoom Plus</h1>
This document lists add-ons for various browsers which are similar to Thumbnail Zoom Plus.  These
can be inspiration for new features or for web site support.
<h2>Thumbnail Zoom (firefox)</h2>
This is the add-on from which Thumbnail Zoom Plus forked.  It is now obsolete
since TZP has all its capabilities and many more, and Thumbnail Zoom hasn't
been updated for a long time.
<p>
Sites are defined by explicit javascript rules like this:
<pre>
// For 500px.com change
// http://pcdn.500px.net/6151440/23d1e866fda841f169e5f1bc5a329a7c217392cd/2.jpg to
// http://pcdn.500px.net/6151440/23d1e866fda841f169e5f1bc5a329a7c217392cd/4.jpg
aImageSrc = aImageSrc.replace(new RegExp("(https?://[^/?]*\\.500px\\.net/.*)/[123](" + 
                                  EXTS + ")"),
                                  "$1/4$2");
</pre>
Some sites have their own "page" and preferences checkbox, which
involves more lines of declaration, but most sites are like above
in either the Others or Thumbnails rule.
<p>
Note that we include (as a comment) an example transformation; it
might be useful to automate use of these as test cases.

<h2>HoverZoom (chrome)</h2>
This is a strong competitor to TZP, on the Google Chrome browser.  IT has some
features and site support which TZP doesn't and vice versa. The author says
he's working on porting it to Firefox.
<p>
Recently the developer has added several features which mimic ones in 
Thumbnail Zoom Plus, reportedly after users suggested them
(presumably after using TZP).
<p>
I think HoverZoom's code base is somewhat cleaner than TZP's and
its site definitions are in a better plug-in architecture to
encourage other developers to submit new site support.

<p>Each site is defined in its own .js file in the plugins directory.
A site definition sets a global variable named like the source file.
It appends to that variable a json dict, one of whose fields is
an arbitrary javascript function which could do
anything.  It uses jquery.  Here's an example:

<pre>

var hoverZoomPlugins = hoverZoomPlugins || [];
hoverZoomPlugins.push( {
        name: '500px',
        version: '0.2',
        prepareImgLinks: function(callback) {
                var res = [];
                hoverZoom.urlReplace(res, 
                        'img[src*="/1.jpg"], img[src*="/2.jpg"], img[src*="/3.jpg"]',
                        /(.*pcdn.*)\/[123]\.jpg/,
                        '$1/4.jpg'
                );              
                hoverZoom.urlReplace(res, 
                        'a img.changed[src*="/4.jpg"]',
                        '/4.jpg',
                        '/4.jpg#'
                );              
                callback($(res));       
        }
});

<h2>Photozoom for Google+, Facebook, ... (chrome)</h2>
This is a fork of HoverZoom "with some new features".  Reported not working
anymore, though.

<h2>Mouseover Popup Image Viewer (userscript)</h2>
This is a userscript for various browsers including Firefox via Greasemonkey.
<br>
It has a nice concise JSON list of dicts syntax for defining the site rules.
Here are a couple examples:
<pre>
{r:/500px\.com\/photo\//, q:'#mainphoto'},
{r:/(https?:\/\/[\w\.\-]+?fbcdn\.net\/[\w\/\.\-]+?)_[a-z]\.jpg/, html:true, 
 s:function(m) { return m[1].replace(/\/[spc][\d\.x]+/g, '') + '_n.jpg'; }},
</pre>
The approach it takes for 500px.com is interesting: instead of doing find-and-replace
in the thumb's URL, it reads the linked-to page, and displays the image
that page defines for id "mainphoto".  It's slower since it must read the 
page but may be easier to define.

</ul>
<h2>ImagePreviewer &amp; LinkRedirector (opera, chrome, Firefox)</h2>
Rules are defined as preferences like this:
<pre>
{
"name"     :"Facebook",
"update"   :"2012-04-09T15:10:00+09:00",
"use"      : true,
"url"      :"^https?://www\\.facebook\\.com/photo\\.php\\?",
"img"      :"(?:/\\w\\d+x\\d+)?(/[^/]*)_[a-z]\\.(?:jpeg?|jpg|gif|bmp|png)$",
"replace"  :"$1_n.$2",
"type"     :"image/jpeg"
},

<h2>PopTip User Script</h2>
Sites defined using "SITEINFO" format.  Example:
<pre>
    {
        description: 'Amazon.co.jp SearchResult',
        url: '^http://www\\.amazon\\.co\\.jp/s/',
        linkElement: '//td[@class="imageColumn"]//a',
        popupElement: 'id("productDescription")',
        delay: 300,
        stripe: true,
        style: {
            fontSize: '80%',
            width: '500px',
            padding: '5px',
            border: '1px solid orange'
        }
    },</pre>

<h1>Other Types of Software</h1>
These are software other than thumbnail popup icons, but which may provide inspiration.

<h2>htts-finder Firefox add-on</h2>
Its preferences GUI lets the user define site-specific rules.
<br>

<h2>AutoPager Firefox Add-on</h2>
This has a very elaborate editor for adding sites based partly on clicking on relevant areas of the page
being added.  It also supports multiple rule sets and importing and publishing rules.  
<br>
Its "Manage Setting" tab's "sites"
area is an example of a preference-window editor which lets you select something and then
edit the data fields of that thing.
