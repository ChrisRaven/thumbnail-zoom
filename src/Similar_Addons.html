<h1>Add-ons Similar To Thumbnail Zoom Plus</h1>
This document lists add-ons for various browsers which are similar to Thumbnail Zoom Plus.  These
can be inspiration for new features or for web site support.
<h2>Thumbnail Zoom (firefox)</h2>
This is the add-on from which Thumbnail Zoom Plus forked.  It is now obsolete
since TZP has all its capabilities and many more, and Thumbnail Zoom hasn't
been updated for a long time.
<p>
Sites are defined by explicit javascript rules like this:
<pre>
// For 500px.com change
// http://pcdn.500px.net/6151440/23d1e866fda841f169e5f1bc5a329a7c217392cd/2.jpg to
// http://pcdn.500px.net/6151440/23d1e866fda841f169e5f1bc5a329a7c217392cd/4.jpg
aImageSrc = aImageSrc.replace(new RegExp("(https?://[^/?]*\\.500px\\.net/.*)/[123](" + 
                                  EXTS + ")"),
                                  "$1/4$2");
</pre>
Some sites have their own "page" and preferences checkbox, which
involves more lines of declaration, but most sites are like above
in either the Others or Thumbnails rule.
<p>
Note that we include (as a comment) an example transformation; it
might be useful to automate use of these as test cases.

<h2>HoverZoom (chrome)</h2>
This is a strong competitor to TZP, on the Google Chrome browser.  IT has some
features and site support which TZP doesn't and vice versa. The author says
he's working on porting it to Firefox.
<p>
Recently the developer has added several features which mimic ones in 
Thumbnail Zoom Plus, reportedly after users suggested them
(presumably after using TZP).
<p>
I think HoverZoom's code base is somewhat cleaner than TZP's and
its site definitions are in a better plug-in architecture to
encourage other developers to submit new site support.

<p>Each site is defined in its own .js file in the plugins directory.
A site definition sets a global variable named like the source file.
It appends to that variable a json dict, one of whose fields is
an arbitrary javascript function which could do
anything.  It uses jquery.  Here's an example:

<pre>

var hoverZoomPlugins = hoverZoomPlugins || [];
hoverZoomPlugins.push( {
        name: '500px',
        version: '0.2',
        prepareImgLinks: function(callback) {
                var res = [];
                hoverZoom.urlReplace(res, 
                        'img[src*="/1.jpg"], img[src*="/2.jpg"], img[src*="/3.jpg"]',
                        /(.*pcdn.*)\/[123]\.jpg/,
                        '$1/4.jpg'
                );              
                hoverZoom.urlReplace(res, 
                        'a img.changed[src*="/4.jpg"]',
                        '/4.jpg',
                        '/4.jpg#'
                );              
                callback($(res));       
        }
});

<h2>Photozoom for Google+, Facebook, ... (chrome)</h2>
This is a fork of HoverZoom "with some new features".  Reported not working
anymore, though.

<h2>Mouseover Popup Image Viewer (userscript)</h2>
This is a userscript for various browsers including Firefox via Greasemonkey.
<br>
It has a nice concise JSON list of dicts syntax for defining the site rules.
Here are a couple examples:
<pre>
{r:/500px\.com\/photo\//, q:'#mainphoto'},
{r:/(https?:\/\/[\w\.\-]+?fbcdn\.net\/[\w\/\.\-]+?)_[a-z]\.jpg/, html:true, 
 s:function(m) { return m[1].replace(/\/[spc][\d\.x]+/g, '') + '_n.jpg'; }},
</pre>
The approach it takes for 500px.com is interesting: instead of doing find-and-replace
in the thumb's URL, it reads the linked-to page, and displays the image
that page defines for id "mainphoto".  It's slower since it must read the 
page but may be easier to define.

<h2>ImagePreviewer &amp; LinkRedirector (opera, chrome, Firefox)</h2>
Rules are defined as preferences like this:
<pre>
{
"name"     :"Facebook",
"update"   :"2012-04-09T15:10:00+09:00",
"use"      : true,
"url"      :"^https?://www\\.facebook\\.com/photo\\.php\\?",
"img"      :"(?:/\\w\\d+x\\d+)?(/[^/]*)_[a-z]\\.(?:jpeg?|jpg|gif|bmp|png)$",
"replace"  :"$1_n.$2",
"type"     :"image/jpeg"
},

<h2>Imagus for Opera</h2>
Not on the official add-on site so I didn't install it.  The site indicates it has some interesting features:
<ul>
<li>Send Image To... sends to online service such as reverse image search, 
image editor, gif frame extractor, etc.  New services can be added in preference
<li>"Sieve" rules to find larger image.  Configurable in preferences as set of replacements.
But add-on updates require user to manually update his "sieve".
<li>Grants to enable/disable on certain sites.  Grant syntax
<pre>
 Syntax: grant operator (optionally followed by rules separated with commas) colon address
(!|!!|~|~~)[rule1,rule2,...]:(*|string|regular expression)
Also there is possibility to add comment lines, simply by starting the line with a ; (semicolon).
When you double the grant operator (! or ~), then it means that you want use regular expression in the URL. "*" means everything.
</pre> (see link for more).<br>
The UI is just a big text field, but what cool is that it's an ordered list of allow/deny rules, which
support both black-listing and white-listing and regular expressions.
<li>Has preference to enable loading higher resolution images.  Users 'Tab' key to switch between
lo/hi on a particular popup.
<li>Doc has nice detailed descriptions (though aimed at very technical users).
</ul>

<h2>Site Blacklisting GUIs</h2>
Hoverzoom:
<ul><li>Has a list of sites as domain names or domain/path.  <li>
Has Add, Remove, Clear buttons.  <li>
Help text: "Be aware that domain filters can overlap. Example: if you have filtered "picasaweb.google.com"
 and "google.com", removing "picasaweb.google.com" will not reactivate Picasa Web Albums, as it will still
 be excluded by the "google.com" filter."<li>
Location bar has Hoverzoom with icon to disable for the current site; it addes eg reddit.com to the blacklist.  
<li>
Location bar popup also has "Disable for all sites", which turns off its global "Enable" checkbox.
</ul>
Imagus:
<ul
<li>As far as I can tell from reading its page, configuration is just a multi-line
text field, with a powerful language for defining include/exclude rules.
The last matching rule is used.
</ul>
Autopager:
<ul>
<li>Has 'Ignore Sites' list, with  * and ? wildcards.
<li>Add button defaults to last-viewed page.
<li>Also has list of autopager config files, with Up/Down buttons and Enable checkbox for
in a line's editor.
</ul>

Proposal for Thumbnail Zoom Plus:
<ul>
<li>Enable/Disable sites: the first matching rule in this list applies.
<li>Initial GUI could just be a big text field parsing lines
<li>Improved GUI could be list box with editor widgets for currently-selected
item, Add, Remove, Edit, Up, and Down buttons.
<li>Fields for each rule:<br>
Site | Enable/Disable/Unchanged[?]
<li>Unclear whether there should be a single 'disable' flag, which eg filters
only based on site's web page, or whether it should also filter
based on the image's site, using the same or a separate Enable checkbox.
<li>For "Site", use "*" for simple wildcards (in the future might support
regexp if there's a need).
<li>If it's disabled for a site, should it still register any event handlers?
Should it allow popups with Shift?
<li>This will require enough space in the Preferences dialog that we'll
need to start using tabs.
</ul>
