     We want to set cursor: none, but due to a bug seen in Firefox 11 on Mac,
     the cursor sometimes gets stuck invisible after popdown.  As a workaround,
     instead of using none, we set cursor to a transparent image.
     Problem seen on the 4th image (which sets a non-default cursor)
     on the Reddit framing of this imgur page:
