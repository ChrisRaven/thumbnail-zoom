Thumbnail Zoom Plus</a> Test Cases</h1>

[<a href="http://0.0.0.0:8000/TestCases.html">local http version</a>]<br>

<h2>General Instructions</h2>
<p>Test in the most recent released version of Firefox, the beta, the nightly, and the oldest supported (eg version 3).
<p>Run tests in Private Browsing mode so they don't depend on your "logged-in" 
state (but the drawback is that if you fix a bug and want to restart, you'll lose the browser's state).
<p>Try tests with both http and https (on Twitter you may need to change
a Twitter site pref to enable http).
<ul>
<li>Test basic popping up of thumbs.
<li>Verify that the popup dismisses when you mouse away from the thumb, click the page,
press Escape, switch tabs, use Control-L and enter a different URL, navigate away by
the back or forward keys, or close the window with Control-W / Apple-W
<li>Display popup; then drag page to open space to open in new window.  The 
hover thumb in the dragged page.  Verify that popup appears in the new page 
and not in the old one.
<li>Repeat tab-dragging, but back into original window.
<li>After testing, open the Error Console (Shift+Apple+r) and verify no errors from
the add-on.
<li>Perform the following tests with non-default page zoom.
<li>Instead of moving mouse onto a thumb, scroll thumb to be under mouse (using mouse
wheel or track pad).  Verify that popup appears.  Scroll thumb out of mouse.
Verify that popup disappears.
<li>Test for factors related to the geometry of the thumb, image, and browser window.  
<li>Verify correct placement of the popup adjcent to or on top of the thumb (depending on the preference).
<li>Test with all languages for which the add-on has translations (see its locale dir).
Set in about:config general.useragent.locale, with intl.locale.matchOS=false.
</ul>


<h2>Facebook</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Levis?sk=wall">Facebook: Levi's: Wall</a>.  
<ul>
  <li>Verify popup on "Levis" small profile thumb, photo thumbs at top of page,
larger photos on the Wall.  
  <li>Click a wall photo after its 
popup appears.  Verify that the popup is dismissed as the photo opens in its Theater-mode page.
  <li>After popup appears, use Control+L / Apple-L and enter facebook.com.  
Verify that popup dismisses.  Verify that popups work on the page you now have loaded.

    <li>
    Hover over a large thumb of a person who was "followed", in the same box as a "follow" button.
    (Doesn't currently work except sometimes when entered from below; a div

<ul>

  verify it's detected as twitpic.

<li>https version of <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/TheRomMistress/media/grid">another user's images.</a>
</ul>


<h2>TwitPic</h2>
<p>Note that we can't work on thumbs hosted at http://s3.amazonaws.com/

<ul>
<li>hover over small thumbs in Latest Photos From Users area.

</ul>

<h2>Google Plus</h2>

(if G+ pops up its own little popup, hover the image in that).  Hover photos in the stream.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=grand+teton&f=hp">Flickr search results</a>: hover over results thumbs, 
with thumbs at Small, Medium, and Detail sizes.
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sathishcj/2887178930/sizes/s/in/photostream/">A particular photo's page</a>:

Hover over movie thumbs and links.

<h2>deviantArt</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.deviantart.com/">deviantArt home</a>: 
<ul>
<li>popups should appear from images, and should disappar when you click an image (which tests the hash-change listener).
<li>because thumbs are laid out in a grid covering most of the page, and images tend to be large, this is a good
site to test popup positioning.  Try with Maximize Image Size By Overlapping Thumbnail both off and on.  With it off, verify that images
are positioned with an edge neary touching the thumb, and opposite edge touching the edge
of the browser (assuming it's a large image).  Test on horizontal and vertical aspect
images.  Test with page zoomed in and out.
